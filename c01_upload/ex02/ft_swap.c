/*
The function ft_swap takes two integer pointers a and b as arguments and swaps the values they point to.
It uses a temporary variable backup to store the value pointed to by a, then assigns the value pointed to by b to the location pointed to by a, and finally assigns the value stored in backup to the location pointed to by b.
In the main function, we declare two integer variables x and y, and initialize them with the values 1 and 9, respectively. We then print their values and memory addresses before calling ft_swap to swap their values. 
After the swap, we print their values again to verify that they have been swapped successfully. Finally, we return 0 to indicate that the program finished successfully.
