/* 
The function ft_ultimate_div_mod takes two integer pointers a and b as arguments.
It calculates the integer division of the value pointed to by a, by the value pointed to by b and stores the result in a temporary variable div.
It also calculates the modulus of the value pointed to by a, by the value pointed to by b and stores the result in a temporary variable mod.
Then, it updates the value pointed to by a to be the result of the division (div) and updates the value pointed to by b to be the result of the modulus (mod).
In the main function, we declare two integer variables x and y, and initialize them with the values 10 and 3, respectively. 
We print their values before calling ft_ultimate_div_mod to show the initial state.
We then call ft_ultimate_div_mod with the addresses of x and y as arguments, which will update x to be the result of 10 divided by 3 (which is 3) and y to be the result of 10 modulus 3 (which is 1).
Finally, we print their values after the function call to verify that they have been updated correctly.
The expected output will be: | Before: x = 10, y = 3 | After: x = 3, y = 1
